## Getting Started

### Requirements

- iOS 26.4
- Xcode 15.0+
- Swift 5.9+
- CocoaPods (for dependencies)

### Running the Project

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `pod install` in the project directory
3. Open `flukavike.xcworkspace` in Xcode
4. Select an iOS Simulator or device
5. Build and run (⌘+R)

---

## Customization

### Adding a New Theme

Edit `ThemeManager.swift`:

```swift
enum AppTheme: String, CaseIterable, Identifiable {
    case system = "System"
    case light = "Light"
    case dark = "Dark"
    case oled = "OLED Dark"
    case yourTheme = "Your Theme" // Add here
}
```

### Adding a New Accent Color

```swift
enum AccentColor: String, CaseIterable, Identifiable {
    // ... existing colors
    case yourColor = "Your Color"
    
    var color: Color {
        switch self {
        // ... existing cases
        case .yourColor: return Color(red: ..., green: ..., blue: ...)
        }
    }
}
```

# What NOT to touch see below

## Critical: Message Decoding — Mixed-Type Fluxer Objects

**Do not simplify the `MessageReference` or `EmojiObject` structs in `Models.swift`.**

Fluxer's API returns two objects that cannot be decoded as `[String: String]`:

- **`message_reference`** — contains a `type` field with an **integer** value alongside string fields. Decoding as `[String: String]` throws a `typeMismatch` error that propagates up and fails the entire message array, breaking history loading on any channel with replied-to messages.

- **`emoji`** (inside reactions) — contains `id` (integer or null) and `animated` (bool) alongside the `name` string. Same consequence: one bad reaction kills the whole channel decode.

Both are handled with private typed structs (`MessageReference`, `EmojiObject`) that only decode the fields actually needed, with `try?` used at the call sites so any unexpected shape produces a nil rather than a throw.

**File:** `Models/Models.swift` — search for `⚠️ WARNING` to find all three affected sites.

---

## Critical: Channel Loading Architecture

**Do not change how channels are fetched without reading this first.**

Fluxer does **not** return channel data from the REST endpoint `GET /guilds/{id}/channels` — that endpoint always returns an empty array `[]` for regular user tokens, regardless of guild membership or permissions.

Channels are delivered exclusively through the **WebSocket Gateway READY event**, the same pattern Discord uses for large guilds. The READY payload includes a `guilds` array where each guild object contains its full channel list.

The channel loading flow is:

1. `FluxerApp` connects the WebSocket on login
2. When the Gateway sends `READY`, `onReady` stores `ready.guilds` into `AppState.gatewayGuilds`
3. `HomeView.loadChannels(for:)` checks `appState.gatewayGuilds` first and uses the channels from there
4. `HomeView` has an `.onChange(of: appState.gatewayGuilds)` observer that reloads channels if the READY event arrives after the initial server list load
5. The REST call at the bottom of `loadChannels` is a last-resort fallback only (it will return `[]` on Fluxer but may work on other compatible instances)

**Files involved:**
- `FluxerApp.swift` — `webSocketService.onReady` callback
- `Stores/ThemeManager.swift` — `AppState.gatewayGuilds`
- `Views/Home/HomeView.swift` — `loadChannels(for:)` and `.onChange(of: appState.gatewayGuilds)`
